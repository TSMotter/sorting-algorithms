# bubble_sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list. The main characteristics of Bubble Sort are:

- It's easy to understand and implement.
- It has a worst-case and average-case time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted, making it inefficient for large lists.
