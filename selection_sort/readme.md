# selection_sort

Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted part. The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part is empty, and the unsorted part is the entire list.

The main characteristics of selection sort are:

- It is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn't require any extra memory to sort the elements.
- It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements in the sorted array.
- It has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it inefficient for large data sets.
