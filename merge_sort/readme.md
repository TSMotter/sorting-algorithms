# merge_sort

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input array into two halves, recursively sorting each half, and then merging the two sorted halves together.

The main characteristics of merge sort are:

- It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning it preserves the relative order of equal elements in the sorted array.
- It has a guaranteed worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).
- It requires extra memory proportional to the size of the input array, as temporary arrays are used to store the sub-arrays being merged.
