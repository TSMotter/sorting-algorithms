# insertion_sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as QuickSort, MergeSort, or HeapSort. The main characteristics of Insertion Sort are:

- It's simple and efficient for small data sets or partially sorted data sets.
- It has a best-case time complexity of O(n) when the input is already sorted or nearly sorted.
- It has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2).
